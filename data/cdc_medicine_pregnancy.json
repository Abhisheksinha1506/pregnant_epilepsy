        "Almost all pregnant women face decisions about taking medicines during pregnancy. Many need to take medicines during pregnancy to treat health conditions. In some cases, avoiding or stopping a medicine during pregnancy may be more harmful than taking it.",
        "And yet, certain medicines during pregnancy can increase the risk for health problems, such as some birth defects, prematurity, or pregnancy loss."

      "content": [
        "Medicine use during pregnancy is common. About 9 in 10 women report taking some type of medicine during pregnancy. About 7 in 10 report taking at least one prescription medicine. From 1997â€“2018, use of at least one prescription medication in the first trimester increased 35%. 1 2",
        "Safety information is lacking. Fewer than 10% of medicines approved since 1980 have enough information to determine their safety during pregnancy. This is because pregnant women are often not included in studies that determine the safety of new medicines. 3",
        "As a result, women and healthcare professionals have limited information to make informed treatment decisions during pregnancy."

      "title": "Should I take acetaminophen during pregnancy?",
      "content": [
        "Some studies of acetaminophen during pregnancy have shown an association with neurological conditions such as autism and ADHD, particularly when taken chronically throughout pregnancy. Although a direct causal relationship between acetaminophen and autism or ADHD has not been established, pregnant women should consider avoiding acetaminophen use during pregnancy as a precaution. Although high fevers have been shown to be associated with birth defects, low grade fevers generally do not require any medication. If a pregnant woman is ever in doubt about fevers, she should consult with a physician about treatment options."

Many websites post lists of medicines that are \"safe\" to take during pregnancy. However, for many medicines listed, there is not enough scientific evidence of their safety during pregnancy."
